Handwritten Digit Recognition is a deep learning-based project that classifies digits (0–9) from handwritten input images. This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately predict digits from the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset in computer vision and machine learning.

🧠 Project Objective:
To build and train a deep learning model capable of identifying handwritten digits from image data with high accuracy, using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

📌 Key Features:
🔍 Preprocessing & Normalization – Input images are resized, normalized, and reshaped to feed into the neural network.

🧱 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Model architecture includes convolution, pooling, and dense layers for effective feature extraction and classification.

📊 High Accuracy – Achieves over 98% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.

📈 Training Visualization – Accuracy and loss graphs are plotted to monitor performance.

📥 Real-Time Prediction (Optional) – Allows user-drawn digits to be predicted via a custom GUI or image upload.

📦 Lightweight Model – Optimized model that can be integrated into mobile apps or web interfaces.

🔧 Technologies Used:
Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

Dataset: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)

💡 Learning Outcomes:
This project helped deepen my understanding of deep learning, image processing, CNN architecture, model training, and evaluation. It also demonstrated how deep learning can be used in real-world applications like postal code reading, banking (cheque processing), and digitized forms.
